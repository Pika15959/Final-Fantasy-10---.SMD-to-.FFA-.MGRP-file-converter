Take any .SMD model and drag it onto the python file above.

Enter in the frame 'chunks' you desire e.g. 5,10,18.

Automatically this will create 3 animations in an .FFA file compatible with Final Fantasy 10;
the first animation will consis of the first 5 frames of your custom SMD file. the next will be the next 10 frames of it etc.

Basically this is a way of being able to custom animate FF10/FF12 or FFX-2 models if you have their .SMD model in Blender.

Note: You need Blender Source Tools Addon to import and export .smd models and animations.
(Though I may work on ways to do this with other more common file formats e.g. FBX or .DAE files in the future)
