Take any .SMD animation and drag it onto the python file above.

Enter in the frame 'chunks' you desire e.g. 5,10,18.

Automatically this will create 3 animations in an .FFA file compatible with Final Fantasy 10;
the first animation will consis of the first 5 frames of your custom SMD file. the next will be the next 10 frames of it etc.

Basically this is a way of being able to custom animate FF10/FF12 or FFX-2 models if you have their .SMD model in Blender.

Note:
1) To work with a model in FF10, it has to match or be that characters skeletal model. i.e. Tidus SMD animation exports will only work on Tidus in the game obviously.

2) You need Blender Source Tools Addon to import and export .smd models and animations.
(Though I may work on ways to do this with other more common file formats e.g. FBX or .DAE files in the future)
